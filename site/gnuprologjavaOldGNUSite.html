  <title>GNU Prolog for Java</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>The gnuprologjava package by Constantine Plotnikov is an implementation of
  ISO Prolog as a Java library (gnu.prolog). We are looking for a new
  maintainer (Constantine is willing to answer questions and provide
  suggestions, but has no time to support it).</p>

  <p>The first thing to do is ensure that the package works with GNU Classpath
  and/or the now-freed parts of <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/">openjdk</a>,
  not just the proprietary JDK release from Sun. Other ideas from
  Constantine:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It should really compile to JVM bytecodes to fasten things up and the
    compiled code should be more optimal with respect to unification and head
    matching.</li>

    <li>It should support part 2 of the ISO standard (modules).</li>

    <li>More documentation is required.</li>

    <li>The parser should be redesigned.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://gnuprologjava.sourceforge.net/">gnuprologjava project at
  sourceforge</a>.</p>

  <p>If you're interested, please take a look at this <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/help/evaluation.html#whatmeans">general information about
  GNU packages and being a GNU maintainer</a>, and then email
  maintainers@gnu.org with a bit about your background and interest.
  Thanks!</p>
